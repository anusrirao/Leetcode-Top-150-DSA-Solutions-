/**
 * LeetCode 121: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock (Easy)
 * Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/
 *
 * Problem:
 * You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a stock on the i-th day.
 * Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve by buying on one day and selling on a later day.
 * If no profit possible, return 0.
 *
 * Example:
 * Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
 * Output: 5 (buy on day 2 at 1, sell on day 5 at 6)
 *
 * Approach:
 * One pass — keep track of minimum price seen so far.
 * At each day, calculate profit if sold today (current - minPrice).
 * Update maxProfit and minPrice as needed.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n)
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
 *
 * Learned: Greedy pattern — track minimum and calculate profit on the fly.
