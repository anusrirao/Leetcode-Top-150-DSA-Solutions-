/**
 * LeetCode 58: Length of Last Word (Easy)
 * Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/length-of-last-word/
 *
 * Problem:
 * Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word.
 * A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.
 *
 * Example:
 * Input: s = "Hello World"
 * Output: 5 ( "World" is the last word)
 *
 * Approach:
 * Trim trailing spaces.
 * Find the last space and calculate length from there to end.
 * (Alternative: Iterate from end, count non-space characters until space).
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n)
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
 *
 * Learned: Simple string traversal from end for last element problems.
