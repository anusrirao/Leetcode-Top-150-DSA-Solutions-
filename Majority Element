/**
 * LeetCode 169: Majority Element (Easy)
 * Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/
 *
 * Problem:
 * Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.
 * The majority element appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times.
 * You may assume the majority element always exists.
 *
 * Example:
 * Input: nums = [3,2,3]
 * Output: 3
 *
 * Approach (Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm):
 * - Maintain a candidate and a count.
 * - If count == 0, set candidate to current element.
 * - Increment count if same as candidate, decrement otherwise.
 * - Since majority > n/2, it will be the final candidate.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n) — single pass
 * Space Complexity: O(1) — only two variables
 *
 * Learned: Clever voting/cancellation for O(1) space when majority guaranteed.
